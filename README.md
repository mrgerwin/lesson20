OOP Pong

### Enhancements

Take the Pong Game from github and enhance it to include:

1) Two balls instead of one, they should be two different colors.

2) Program another set of paddles to play in the front row for players 3 and 4.

You should be able to do this just using 15 additional lines of code.  3 Lines to make the extra ball and two paddles and 12 lines to make the event handlers for players 3 and 4.

### Discussion Questions:
1) Where did you look to make sure that you were declaring a paddle object correctly?  Explain.

2) If both ball objects are ball objects, why aren't they moving along the same paths?

3) One might wonder why I didn't have to program a collide handler for each paddle.  Does it matter to the ball which paddle it hits for the program to function correctly?  Explain.

4) Along that line of logic, what would happen if the ball collides with the back of a front player's paddle?

5) What happens logically when the ball hits the side of the paddle and actually travels through the paddle?
